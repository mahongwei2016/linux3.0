/**
 * @defgroup uk_api_user UKU (User side)
 *
 * The UKU is an OS independent API for user-side code which provides functions to
 * - open and close a UKK client driver, a kernel-side device driver implementing the UK interface
 * - call functions inside a UKK client driver
 * 
 * The code snippets below show an example using the UKU API:
 *
 * Start with opening the imaginary Midgard Base UKK client driver
 *
@code 
    mali_error ret;
    uku_context uku_ctx;
    uku_client_version client_version;
    uku_open_status open_status;

    // open a user-kernel context
    client_version.major = TESTDRV_UK_MAJOR;
    client_version.minor = TESTDRV_UK_MINOR;
    open_status = uku_open(UK_CLIENT_MALI_T600_BASE, &client_version, &uku_ctx);
    if (UKU_OPEN_OK != open_status)
    {
        mali_tpi_printf("failed to open a user-kernel context\n");
        goto cleanup;
    }
@endcode
 *
 * We are going to call a function foo in the Midgard Base UKK client driver. For sample purposes this
 * function foo will simply copy an input buffer to an output buffer and prefix it with the
 * string "Foo:". 
 *
 * First we setup the header of the argument structure to identify that we are calling the
 * a function foo in the Midgard Base UKK client driver identified with the id BASE_UK_FOO_FUNC.
 *
@code 
    base_uk_foo_args foo_args;
    foo_args.header.id = BASE_UK_FOO_FUNC;
@endcode
 * 
 * Followed by the setup of the arguments for the function foo.
 *
@code 
    foo_args.input_buffer = (void *)"buffer content to pass on";
    foo_args.input_buffer_size = cutils_cstr_len((char *)foo_args.input_buffer, 512) + 1;
    foo_args.output_buffer_size = 30;
    foo_args.output_buffer = mali_tpi_alloc(foo_args.output_buffer_size);
    if (NULL == foo_args.output_buffer)
    {
        mali_tpi_printf("failed to allocate output buffer for foo\n");
        ret = MALI_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
        goto cleanup;
    }
@endcode
 *
 * Then we use UKU to actually call the function in the Midgard Base UKK client driver.
 *
@code 
    // call kernel-side foo function
    ret = uku_call(uku_ctx, &foo_args, sizeof(foo_args));
    if (MALI_ERROR_NONE == ret && MALI_ERROR_NONE == foo_args.header.ret)
    {
@endcode
 *
 * If the uku_call() function succeeded we can check the return code of the foo function. The return
 * value is returned in the ret field of the header. If it succeeded, we verify here that the
 * foo function indeed copied the input buffer to the output buffer and prefixed it with "Foo:"
 *
@code
        char expected[BUFCHARS+1];
        cutils_cstr_strncpy(expected, BUFCHARS, "Foo:", 4);
        cutils_cstr_strncat(expected, BUFCHARS, (char *)foo_args.input_buffer, foo_args.input_buffer_size);

        // retrieve data returned by kernel-side foo function 
        mali_tpi_printf("foo returned %d bytes as %s\n", foo_args.output_buffer_size, foo_args.output_buffer);

        // data should match 'Foo: ' + input buffer
        if (0 != cutils_cstr_strncmp(expected, (char *)foo_args.output_buffer, foo_args.output_buffer_size))
        {
            // data didn't match: test fails
            ret = MALI_ERROR_FUNCTION_FAILED;
        }
    }
@endcode
 *
 * When we are done, we free any allocated buffers and close the Midgard Base UKK client.
 *
@code
cleanup:
    // free allocated transient buffers
    if (NULL != foo_args.output_buffer)
    {
        mali_tpi_free(foo_args.output_buffer);
        foo_args.output_buffer = NULL;
    }

    // close an opened user-kernel context
    if (UKU_OPEN_OK == open_status)
    {
        uku_close(uku_ctx);
    }

/**
 * @brief Open a connection to a UKK client
 *
 * The User-Kernel interface communicates with a kernel-side driver over
 * an OS specific communication channel. A UKU context object stores the
 * necessary OS specific objects and state information to represent this
 * OS specific communication channel. A UKU context, defined by the
 * uku_context type is passed in as the first argument to nearly all
 * UKU functions. These UKU functions expect the UKU context to be valid,
 * an invalid UKU context will trigger a debug assert (in debug builds).
 *
 * The function uku_open() opens a connection to a kernel-side driver with 
 * a User-Kernel interface, aka UKK client, and returns an initialized 
 * UKU context. The function uku_close() closes the connection to the UKK
 * client. 
 *
 * The kernel-side driver may support multiple instances and the particular
 * instance that needs to be opened is selected by the instance argument.
 * An instance of a kernel-side driver is normally associated with a particular
 * instance of a physical hardware block, e.g. each instance corresponds
 * to one of the ports of a UART controller. See the specifics of the
 * kernel-side driver to find out which instances are supported.
 *
 * As the user and kernel-side of the UK interface are physically two
 * different entities, they might end up using different versions of the 
 * UK interface and therefore part of the opening process makes an
 * internal UK call to verify if the versions are compatible. A version
 * has a major and minor part. Interfaces with different major version 
 * numbers are incompatible. A user-side interface minor version that is equal
 * to or less than the kernel-side interface minor version is compatible. 
 * A user-side interface minor version that is greater than the kernel-side
 * interface minor version is incompatible (as it is requesting more
 * functionality than exists).
 *
 * Each UKK client has a unique id as defined by the uk_client_id
 * enumeration. These IDs are mapped to OS specific device file names
 * that refer to their respective kernel device drivers. Any new UKK client
 * needs to be added to the uk_client_id enumeration.
 *
 * A UKU context must be shareable between threads. It may be shareable
 * between processes. This attribute is mostly dependent on the OS specific 
 * communication channel used to communicate with the UKK client. When 
 * multiple threads use the same UKU context only one should be responsible
 * for closing it and ensuring the other threads are not using it anymore.
 *
 * Opening a UKU context is considered to be an expensive operation, most
 * likely resulting in loading a kernel device driver when opened for
 * the first time in a system. The specific kernel device driver to be
 * opened is defined by the OS specific implementation of this function and
 * is not configurable.
 *
 * Once a UKU context is opened and in use by the user-kernel interface it
 * is expected to operate without error. Any communication error will not
 * result in an attempt by the user-kernel interface implementation to
 * re-establish the OS specific communication channel and is considered
 * to be a non-recoverable fault.
 *
 * Notes on Base driver context and UKU context
 *
 * A UKU context is opened each time a base driver context is created. 
 * A UKU context and base driver context therefore have a 1:1 relationship.
 * A base driver context represents an isolated GPU address space and because 
 * of the 1:1 relationship with a UKU context, a UKU context can also be seen 
 * to present an isolated GPU address space. Each process is currently
 * expected to create one base driver context (and therefore open one UKU
 * context per process), but this might change, having multiple base driver
 * contexts open per process, in case we need to support WebGL, where each
 * GLES context must use a separate GPU address space inside the web browser
 * to prevent seperate brower tabs from interfering with each other.
 *
 * Debug builds will assert when a NULL pointer is passed for the version or
 * uku_ctx parameters, or when an unknown enumerated value for the id parameter 
 * is used.
 *
 * @param[in] id UKK client identifier, see uk_client_id.
 * @param[in] instance instance number (0..) of the UKK client driver
 * @param[in,out] version of the UKU client on input. On output it contains the version
 * of the UKK client, when uku_open returns UKU_OPEN_OK or UKU_OPEN_INCOMPATIBLE,
 * otherwise the output value is undefined.
 * @param[out] uku_ctx address of a Pointer to a User-Kernel context. The User-Kernel
 * context represents a connection with a UKK client. The pointer will be set
 * to NULL (an invalid User-Kernel context) when uku_open failed, ie. returned with UKU_OPEN_FAILED,
 * or UKU_OPEN_INCOMPATIBLE.
 * @return UKU_OPEN_OK when the connection to the UKK client was successful.
 * @return UKU_OPEN_FAILED when the connection to the UKK client could not be established,
 * or the UKK client failed to perform version verification.
 * @return UKU_OPEN_INCOMPATIBLE when the version of the UKK and UKU clients are incompatible.

/**
 * @brief Calls a function in a UKK client
 * 
 * A UKK client defines a structure for each function callable over the UK
 * interface. The structure starts with a header field of type uk_header,
 * followed by the arguments for the function, e.g.
 *
 * @code
 *     typedef struct base_uk_foo_args
 *     {
 *         uk_header header; // first member is the header 
 *         int n;            // followed by function arguments 
 *         int doubled_n;
 *         ...
 *     } base_uk_foo_args;
 * @endcode
 *
 * The header.id field identifies the function to be called. See the UKK 
 * client documentation for a list of available functions and the structure 
 * definitions associated with them.
 *
 * The arguments in the structure can be of type input, input/output or
 * output. All input and input/output arguments must be initialized in the
 * structure before calling the uku_call() function. Memory pointed to by
 * pointers in the structure should at least remain allocated until uku_call
 * returns.
 *
 * When uku_call has successfully executed the function in the UKK client,
 * it stores the return code of the function in the header.ret field, and 
 * only in this case the output and input/output members are considered to
 * be valid in the structure.
 *
 * For example, to call function 'foo' which simply doubles the supplied
 * argument 'n':
 * @code
 *      base_uk_foo_args args;
 *      mali_error ret;
 *
 *      args.header.id = BASE_UK_FOO_FUNC;
 *      args.n = 10;
 *
 *      ret = uku_call(uku_ctx, &args, sizeof(args));
 *      if (MALI_ERROR_NONE == ret)
 *      {
 *          if (MALI_ERROR_NONE == args.header.ret)
 *          {
 *               printf("%d*%d=%d\n", args.n, args.n, args.doubled_n)
 *          }
 *      }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Debug builds will assert when a NULL pointer is passed for uku_ctx or
 * args, or args_size < sizeof(uku_header).
 *
 * @param[in] uku_ctx   Pointer to a valid User-Kernel context. See uku_open.
 * @param[in,out] args  Pointer to an argument structure associated with
 *                      the function to be called in the UKK client.
 * @param[in] args_size Size of the argument structure in bytes
 * @return MALI_ERROR_NONE on success. Any other value indicates failure,
 * and the structure pointed to by args may contain invalid information.
