/**
 * @page page_base_ump Unified Memory Provider API
 *
 * UMP(Universal Memory Provider) is an API to allocate memory with some special unique requirements;
 * @li Known physical addresses
 * @li Non-relocatable/pinned
 * @li Won't be paged out
 * @li Shareable between processes (selectable per allocation for security reasons)
 * @li Shareable with multiple hardware devices
 * @li Physically contiguous (optional)
 * @li Extended (not valid with the physically contiguous requirement for obvious reasons)
 *
 * Allocations from UMP can safely be used with hardware devices and other processes.
 * All uses are reference counted, so memory won't be released until all participating hardware devices and processes have released their use of the allocation.
 * This means that even if a process frees memory too early or crashes any hardware using the memory won't corrupt freed memory.
 *
 * Allocations inside a process is represented using an UMP memory handle.
 *
 * Each allocation is represented by a system-wide unique ID (called a secure ID),
 * which can be obtained from a handle and be shared with other processes or given to a device driver.
 *
 * Based on a secure ID a new handle can be created either in kernel space by a driver
 * or in user space by some other process to use the same allocation.
 *
 * Based on the handle a driver in kernel space can obtain information about the physical memory block(s)
 * an allocation consists of and increment or decrement the reference count.
 *
 * Usage in user-space also adds a reference to the memory, but it's managed by the UMP device driver.
 *
 * The user-space reference count is only local to the process, so a process can't by accident decrement
 * the count one time too many and cause the memory to be freed while it's in use by a hardware device.
 *
 * This is all handled by the UMP kernel code, no user-space code cooperation is needed.
 *
 * By default an allocation is only accessible in the same process or what other security boundary the OS uses.
 * If marked as shared it can be accessed in all processes, the kernel space customer defined security filter permitting of course.
 * See @ref ump_dd_security_filter for more information about this security filter.
